# Build SharePoint Add-Ins with Kendo UI: Demo

This is an example of what a SharePoint add-in might look like with the Chart, DropDownList, and Scheduler components from Kendo UI.

**Key files and folders located in the project structure:**

-	`Content` The content module for add-in stylesheets (including third-party stylesheets).
-	`Content/App.css` The default stylesheet for the add-in.
-	`Pages/Default.aspx` The default starting page of the add-in.
-	`Scripts` The scripts module for add-in JavaScript resources (including third-party stylesheets).
-	`Scripts/App.js` The default JavaScript file underlying the default starting page.
-	`AppManifest.xml` The deployment package properties for your add-in.

**This application demonstrates how to:**

-	Add Kendo UI into a SharePoint add-in.
-	Reference the CDN-based stylesheets for the Office 365 theme that ships with Kendo UI and matches the default theme of SharePoint (works well with other front-end frameworks like Office UI Fabric).
-	Configure the DataSource to access the SharePoint REST API.
-	Create SharePoint UI with the Chart, DropDownList, and Scheduler components from Kendo UI.

**Why it makes sense to use Kendo UI:**

-	70+ responsive UI components that integrate with the SharePoint REST API.
-	Built-in Office 365 theme.
-	Built-in export functionality to most common office formats, such as Excel, PDF and image files.
-	Compliance with widely-recognized accessibility standards (WAI-ARIA, WCAG 2.0 and Section 508).
